# Attack Test

Aim to emulate some kinds of attacks, and see if the MoniLyzer works well under these classic cases.

1. Portscan. Use `portscan_nmap.sh` or `portscan.sh`.
2. SSH login. No need to craft this kind of attack, because the server is usually being attacked by endless login from various IP.
